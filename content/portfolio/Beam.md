# ![Beam with strut][1]
Design composite carbon beam with fiber-glass strut and articulator connectors.
# ![Beam with strut][2]
Beam has been designed to bearable irregularly distributed load from
75 kN at the assembly unit to -60 kN at the end.

There how is looking only beam with assembly units:

Composite laying scheme of beam looks like:
# ![Laying scheme][4]

Attachment fitting wich connect beam with strut made from 30ChGSA Steel and with using [`Topology optimization`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization).

# ![Fitting_MFE][51]

Strut was made by spooling fiber-glass and gluing assembly units.
